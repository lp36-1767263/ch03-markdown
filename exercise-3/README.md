# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# cd
The `cd` command can be used to navigate directories. For example:

```
cd downloads/college/assignments
```

Here's some more information about the `cd` command:

- It can be used to move through multiple levels at once e.g. `cd users/tommy/pictures/2018`
- To move up a level, use `cd ..`
- To change drives, type drive letter followed by :, e.g. `d:`
